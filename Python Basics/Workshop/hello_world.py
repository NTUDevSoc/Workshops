# Start by printing "Hello World" to make sure we have the IDE set up properly and such
print("Hello World!")

    Show different naming methods that can be used for variables/functions/etc.

    haircolor = Lower case
    HAIRCOLOR = Upper Case

    HairColor = Pascal Case
    hairColor = Camel Case
    Note: the only difference between camelCase and PascalCase is the Uppercase letter at the start of the first word

    hair_color = snake case

    These aren't all available methods of naming things but these are the ones that I use.
    camelCase for variables
    PascalCase for functions
    snake_case for files/folders

    E.g.
    hairColor = "Brown"
    def GetHairColor()
    hair_color.py


    Some common variable types:
    Number: Can be either an integer or a float. E.g. 3, 4.1, 4123.0758
    String: E.g. "Hello"
    List: A collection of other variables, the items in a list can be changed:
        E.g. ["Hello", 13, True, "Cheese"]
    Tuple: Similar to a list, except you can't change the items within a Tuple:
        E.g. ("Hello", 14, False, "Cheese")
    Dictionary: A collection of key-value pairs, basically makes a list of "named" variables:
        E.g. {"Three": 3, "Four": 4,, "Seven": 7}
